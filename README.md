# Exact Knockoff sampling with MH-SCEP

#### Description

This is a collection of scripts in R and Python that sample *exact* knockoffs for graphical models via the method of *Metropolis–Hastings Sequential Conditional Exchangeable Pairs* (MH-SCEP). Scripts are grouped by the distribution of the original feature. Currently scripts for discrete Markov chains, continuous Markov chains (Gaussian, heavy-tailed, and asymmetric), and Ising/Potts models on grids are available.

Correspondence should be addressed to Stephen Bates (stephen6@stanford.edu) and Wenshuo Wang (wenshuo_wang@g.harvard.edu).
